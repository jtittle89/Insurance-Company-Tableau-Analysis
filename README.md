Claims Operations Performance Dashboard

This project analyzes insurance claims operational performance using Tableau. The goal is to provide stakeholders with clear, actionable insights into claim volumes, processing efficiency, SLA compliance, and bottlenecks across departments and claim types.

The dashboard enables operations and management teams to quickly assess performance trends, identify aging claims, and pinpoint areas requiring process improvement.

Business Objectives

    Monitor overall claims workload and financial impact
    
    Evaluate processing efficiency and turnaround times
    
    Track Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance over time
    
    Identify departments and claim types contributing to delays
    
    Support data-driven operational decision-making

Dataset Description

The dataset contains insurance claims data with the following key fields:

    Claim ID – Unique identifier for each claim
    
    Claim Status – Current status of the claim (e.g., Open, Closed)
    
    Claim Type – Category/type of insurance claim
    
    Department – Department responsible for processing the claim
    
    Received Date – Date the claim was received
    
    Processed Date – Date the claim was completed
    
    Processing Days – Total number of days to process the claim
    
    Paid Amount – Amount paid on the claim

Dashboard Features
    Filters
    
    Processed Date
    
    Department
    
    Claim Type
    
    Claim Status
    
    These filters allow users to dynamically slice performance metrics across time periods and operational segments.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

    Total Claims – Total number of claims processed
    
    Paid Amount – Total dollar amount paid across claims
    
    SLA Compliance Rate – Percentage of claims processed within SLA thresholds
    
    Average Processing Days – Mean time to process claims

Visualizations

    Monthly SLA Trend (Line Chart)
    Tracks SLA compliance over time to identify performance improvements or declines.
    
    Aged Claims by Department (Bar Chart)
    Displays claims grouped into aging buckets to highlight backlog risk by department.
    
    Average Processing Days by Claim Type (Bar Chart)
    Compares processing efficiency across different claim categories.

Key Insights

    Identifies departments with higher concentrations of aged claims
    
    Highlights claim types with longer average processing times
    
    Reveals seasonal or monthly trends impacting SLA compliance
    
    Enables proactive workload and resource management
